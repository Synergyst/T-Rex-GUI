## <img src="T-Rex_GUI_Icon.png" width="86" alt="T-Rex GUI"> T-Rex GUI

This GUI is just a UI where certain features will be added to ease the setup of T-Rex for complete novices

*It is not developed by the T-Rex Miner developers, though [Synergyst](https://github.com/Synergyst/T-Rex-GUI) is the official GitHub repository for this unofficial T-Rex GUI.*

## Features

* Close to tray (keeps miner running without any taskbar icons or console windows)
* Change/set WebUI password with ease

## Recommended usage

* Follow [Installation](https://github.com/Synergyst/T-Rex-GUI#installation) steps
* Rename `config_example` to `config.json` or something else **(So you don't overwrite your custom settings with the default example settings every update!)**
* Click 'Browse' button for `config` section and select your custom configuration file from the previous step
* Enter a new password so you have full-access to the WebUI (Make sure your password fits the requirements. Please read the message box window to verify it did!)
* *Optional (unless you renamed the T-Rex Miner executable):* Click 'Browse' for the 'T-Rex binary filename' section and select whatever you renamed your T-Rex Miner binary filename to
* Close the configuration GUI
* Click 'Start T-Rex' button (make sure that T-Rex starts before next step)
* Click '[T-Rex WebUI Dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:4067)' on either GUI window (hyperlink on GitHub is only for convienence)
* Enter your password you set to login once at the WebUI dashboard logon prompt
* **That's all, happy mining! :)**
* *Optional final step (if you know how to do this why are you using this GUI software in the first place?):* Remove the `T-Rex_GUI.exe` file and make your own custom batch to call the `config.json` file

## Installation

Download the [release](https://github.com/Synergyst/T-Rex-GUI/releases) executable to the same folder with the T-Rex Miner

You should see something like `t-rex.exe`, `T-Rex_GUI.exe` in the same directory if completed correctly.

This GUI is just a UI where certain features will be added to ease the setup of T-Rex for complete novices

It is not developed by the T-Rex Miner developers, though [Synergyst](https://github.com/Synergyst/T-Rex-GUI) is the official GitHub repository.

## Installation

Extract the [release](https://github.com/Synergyst/T-Rex-GUI/releases) zip contents to the same folder with the T-Rex Miner

You should see something like `t-rex.exe`, `T-Rex_GUI.exe`, `T-Rex_GUI.exe.config` in the same directory if completed correctly.
